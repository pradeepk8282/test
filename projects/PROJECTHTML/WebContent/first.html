		<div class="article1"><h1>Tutorial</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the PostgreSQL Tutorial. The following few chapters are intended to give a simple introduction to PostgreSQL,
relational database concepts, and the SQL language to those who are new to any one of these aspects. We
only assume some general knowledge about how to use computers. No particular Unix or programming experience is
required. This part is mainly intended to give you some hands-on experience with important aspects of the PostgreSQL
system. It makes no attempt to be a complete or thorough treatment of the topics it covers.</p>
	<p>After you have worked through this tutorial you might want to move on to reading Part II to gain a more formal
knowledge of the SQL language, or Part IV for information about developing applications for PostgreSQL. Those who
set up and manage their own server should also read Part III.</p></div>

<div class="article2"><h1>The SQL Language</h1>
<p>This part describes the use of the SQL language in PostgreSQL. We start with describing the general syntax of SQL,
then explain how to create the structures to hold data, how to populate the database, and how to query it. The middle
part lists the available data types and functions for use in SQL commands. The rest treats several aspects that are
important for tuning a database for optimal performance.</p>

<p>The information in this part is arranged so that a novice user can follow it start to end to gain a full understanding of the
topics without having to refer forward too many times. The chapters are intended to be self-contained, so that advanced
users can read the chapters individually as they choose. The information in this part is presented in a narrative fashion
in topical units. Readers looking for a complete description of a particular command should see Part VI.</p>

<p>Readers of this part should know how to connect to a PostgreSQL database and issue SQL commands. Readers that
are unfamiliar with these issues are encouraged to read Part I first. SQL commands are typically entered using the
PostgreSQL interactive terminal psql, but other programs that have similar functionality can be used as well.</p>
